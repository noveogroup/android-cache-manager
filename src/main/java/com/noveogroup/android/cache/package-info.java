/**
 * Provides classes of Android Cache Manager.
 * <p>
 * Android Cache Manager contains an Android Disk Cache that implements
 * LRU algorithm to manage cache data stored on the disk.
 * This cache has the following features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Short access time</li>
 * <li>Flexible cleaning settings</li>
 * The cache cleans its storage according to user's settings such as
 * max age of file within the cache and max size of the cache.
 * <li>Thread-safe implementation</li>
 * The same Android Disk Cache can be used by different threads of
 * one JVM, and even by different JVMs.
 * <li>User-friendly interface</li>
 * In addition to main implementation of cache storage there is
 * a simple implementation. New instances of cache can be created
 * without any difficulties just using default settings.
 * <li>Meta data support</li>
 * Users can store additional meta-data with any cache entry.
 * <li>Useful debug mode</li>
 * When debugging is turned on disk cache will emulate additional time delay
 * for I/O operations, delete entries unexpectedly and immediately report
 * any exceptions.
 * <li>Detailed logging</li>
 * <li>Fail-safety</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
